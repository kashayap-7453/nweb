            [124][125] He never owned a television,<br/>
             and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.[126] His few personal possessions included his books, his veena,<br/>
              some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, </p>

              <P><em style="background-color : #1a89171a">Munshi Premchand was famous Indian writer. </em>Unlike many other writers, he never been 
                anywhere outside India. He had faced financial <br/>
                crises during his lifetime. He was married at the age of 15 when he was studying in 9 standard. Due to not having good relationship<br/>
                 his wife, he married a child widow although many people opposed him for doing this. His mother died at an early age and he couldnâ€™t<br/>
                  connect more to his stepmother. After completing his studies, he served as a teacher in different institutes. After that  left his <br/>
                  job and focus on his literary career. And now, we all know him as a great writer.
